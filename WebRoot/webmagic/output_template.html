Modify this file to create your own HTML output document
and save it as <MY_OUTPUT>.html, where <MY_OUTPUT> is replaced
by a name that has meaning within the context of your application.
(Remember that many web servers expect case-sensitive file naming.)

Creating this file involves adding references to the MATLAB
variables that are in the structure passed as the first argument 
to the HTMLREP function in your application M-file.  See HTMLREP
help for details.
-->


<!-- STEP 1
Display a MATLAB scalar or character string.  Replace 
<MY_OUTPUT_VARIABLE_1> in the following line with the name of
the MATLAB variable you want to display.  Change the other text
to something meaningful within the context of your application.
-->
My output variable 1 has been computed to be: $<my_output_variable_1>$



<!-- STEP 2
Put all your other HTML tags here.
